          <h1>Generations of Congress</h1>

          <p>
            This project was inspired by a Politico article titled
            <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/26/how-the-baby-boomers-broke-america-058122" target="_blank">How the baby boomers broke America</a>,
            which suggested that the Baby Boomer generation has had a stronghold on American politics for the past three decades. In the article,
            Ben White points to the streak of Baby Boomer presidents and the current list of Boomers who are leading in the polls for the Democratic
            candidacy (Biden, Warren, Sanders) as evidence of this. He then goes on to cherry-pick a collection of other Baby Boomers who have had an
            impact during this time period, such as John Boehner and Newt Gingrich. Newt Gingrich is arguably from the Silent Generation (born in 1943),
            but that's a fuzzy point since I learned during this research that not everyone agrees on the date range of each generation.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I can't argue with the observation that the recent string of Presidents have all been Baby Boomers, I was left wondering how much of Congress is
            currently made up by that generation and how that's changed over time. What I found was largely what you might guess - a gradual series of waves as each
            generation comes of age and replaces the previous generations' seats. Another pretty obvious finding was that each generation starts it's congressional
            wave in the House of Representatives before starting to move into the Senate. This effect is amplified with Generation X, which leaves me wondering if
            the minimum age that our electorate considers old enough for Congress has gradually lowered. Elise Stefanik and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of course come to
            mind as younger Representatives, but from skimming
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_members_of_the_United_States_Congress" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
            I'm not sure that they are outliers (more research for another day).
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming back around to the article, I was left feeling like the author exagerated a bit by saying that Boomers have had a "three-decade run dominating
            American political life". His points fit nicely around the linked podcast episode but I don't think they entirely hold up when looking at the data.
            Three decades ago was 1990, which is also the year that the Silent Generation reached it's peak at 62% in the House of Representatives. The Baby Boomers'
            share of the House was growing at that point but didn't become the majority generation in the House until 1999. Since then they have maintained more than
            50% of the House, and now their numbers are starting to level off. In the Senate their impact was even more delayed - the Silent Generation held power
            there for almost 30 years until the Boomers gained the majority in late 2007. All of this is not to say that Baby Boomers had no impact in Congress during
            the 90's as their ranks were certainly growing during this time period, but I think it's more appropriate to factor in the impact of the Greatest
            Generation, the Silent Generation, <i>and</i> the Baby Boomers when considering the policies of the past 30 years.

          <p>
            White's article was thought provoking and made some decent points, but I'm not sure that it's realistic to imagine any generation with a stronghold
            over Congress during any given slice of time. Each generation is impacted by the one before it and impacts the one after it. Congress is always a mix
            of newcomers, career politicians, and those who are on their way out the door. Generations are not consistent blocks but instead are somewhat arbitrary
            in their ranges (18 years for the Boomers vs. 15 for Millenials). I think it will be interesting to watch these graphs evolve over time, but in the end
            I don't think that comparing the history of policy based solely on this data point is a particularly helpful lense.

            A note on the charts: Generational labels don't really exist before the Lost Generation started in 1883, so I've left all previous Congress member
            off the charts. This makes it look like Congress didn't exist until the early 1900's, but that's obviously not the case.

          <p>
            The data for each Congress member's date of birth came from the amazing
            <a href="https://theunitedstates.io/" target="_blank">@unitedstates project</a>.
            This project would have been monumentally more difficult without that data.
